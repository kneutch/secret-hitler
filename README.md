secret-hitler
======================

Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before itâ€™s too late.

Current production/stable is found at [Secret Hitler IO](https://secrethitler.io).

## Alterations to the original game ##

Minor image alterations and editing (from scans, assets available upon request).

Veto power is slightly adjusted so that chancellors need to select a policy prior to saying yes or no to vetoing that policy.

Adapted the rules explanation to account for online vs physical play.
