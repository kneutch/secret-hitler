			<div className="ui header">
				<p>Version 0.6.6 "tuotuc" released 8-2-2017</p>
			</div>
			<h3>Small patch to fix a bug that could be used to crash the server thanks to player veggiemanz who now has a shiny orange name.  Also these things:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Shuffling of the deck when its less than 3 should now happen before any election, as per the rules.  This will prevent the "nein all" problem when there's few policies left.</li>
				<li>As you probably saw, there is a notice on the sign in/sign up modals to use Chrome or Firefox for the best experience.</li>
				<li>Fascists who investigate hitler will not have hitler's name change to fascist color.</li>
				<li>Hid the cardback section on settings as that is work in progress.</li>
				<li>Gamelist sort should be better and no longer bounce around as much.</li>
				<li>Confetti should no longer prevent the winners from being able to type in chat while its raining down.</li>
				<li>A fix to chancellor discards not showing up in replays.</li>
			</ul>
			<div className="ui header">
				<p>Version 0.6.5 "cutout" released 7-30-2017</p>
			</div>
			<h3>New feature: creategame player count exclusions.</h3>
			<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
				<img src="images/excludeplayers.png" style={{width: '50%'}}/>
			</div>
			<p>In the create game view, players now have the option to uncheck player counts from starting the game.  For example, if you really hated 7 player games but liked playing 5-10 player games, your new game would not start if there are 7 seated players. Hitting that threshold will cause your 20 second timer to restart, but that's unavoidable.</p>
			<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
				<img src="images/no79.png" style={{width: '50%'}}/>
			</div>
			<p>Other issues:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your name in-game is no longer green - it is the color of your dealt role.  Somehow people were forgetting they're hitler..</li>
				<li>Moderators have a new color.</li>
				<li>Thanks to a contribution, track images have been redone from the original files and colored, unlike my crappy scans.</li>
				<li>Bug fix: player replays are back.</li>
				<li>Bug fix: green players are not all the same color green (based on played games).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next up: player uploaded cardback images!  Fun.  No nazi stuff please..</p>
			<div className="ui header">
				<p>Version 0.6.0 "noise" released 6-12-2017</p>
			</div>
			<h3>New feature: Player profiles</h3>
			<p>Click on a player in the lobby/player list to get detailed information about games they've played. You can access your own stats that way, or through the game settings screen ("gear" icon in upper right corner).</p>
			<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
				<img src="images/profile.png" style={{width: '90%'}}/>
			</div>
			<p>A big change to the back end, and will allow for some more interesting features (like game replays) and analysis in the future.</p>
			<p>This is an epoch event, meaning that only games from here on out will be seen in your profile.</p>
			<h3>New feature: notification for patch notes</h3>
			<p>As you've probably seen, the lizard image in the middle will glow until you click it, showing this changelog.</p>
			<p>Both features courtesy of contributor jbasrai.</p>
			<h4>Please welcome new moderators Jazz and Max.</h4>
			<div className="ui header">
				<p>Version 0.5.0 "glow" released 6-10-2017</p>
			</div>
			<h3>New feature: Player moderation</h3>
			<p>Some players have volunteered to be moderators.  They are empowered to have the ability to ban non-rainbow players for griefing and trolling, and to check for cheating. Hopefully this (and some more advanced powers from admins) will be a permanent solution to problems that may come up.  Moderators will have a red (M) next to their names.</p>
			<h4>Other updates</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>A fix to the rainbow game icon on the gamelist only being there for games that haven't started yet.</li>
				<li>A fix (finally) to dead players being able to chat by leaving the game and coming back.</li>
				<li>A 3 second delay has been implemented between the inactment of a policy by the chancellor, and the ability for the government to make a claim (for non-experienced games only).  This should change game play a lot I think..</li>
				<li>Various tooltips have been added to some items and will continue to be addded in the future.</li>
				<li>A fix to rainbow losses also adding to normal losses, but not the other way around.  I'll see if there's a way to credit those.</li>
				<li>Contribution by player sethe: a fix to the (relatively rare) problem of the election tracker not working right with vetos and neins.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Up next: player profiles.  This is just about ready to go and will be released within the next 2 days.</p>
			<div className="ui header">
				<p>Version 0.4.0 "chestnut" released 6-5-2017</p>
			</div>
			<h3>New feature: Rainbow games.</h3>
			<p>While creating a game, players with more than 50 completed games ("rainbow players") will now be able to create games that only other rainbow players can be seated in. These games have a special symbol in the sidebar.</p>
			<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
				<img src="images/gamelist-rainbow.png" />
			</div>
			<p>In the lobby, a new icon appears showing what game style you are filter and sorting the userlist by.  Click it to switch between "regular" and "rainbow". Effectively, rainbow players get to "start over" in an optional hard mode with a 0-0 score.</p>
			<p><b>For rainbow games, your wins and losses are in a different tier, that does not affect your regular game winrate or player color.</b>  "Rainbow rewards" may come in at some point.</p>
			<p>Also in this release, the karma system has been temporarily disabled due to griefers exploiting it.  The next major feature is <b>player moderation</b>, where I will be enlisting some of our regular players to help out in getting rid of griefers and trolls.  This isn't all that hard and will be coming soon, and hopefully guarantee a better playing experience for everyone.  Please check the github issue if you are interested in helping out.</p>
